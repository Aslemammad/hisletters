A simple POC on Patrick's idea! I think with a proper backup, and few other sources (NYT, ...), we can build a simple customizable newsletter that everyone can subscribe to!

The name is "hisletters" because it's a play on "historyletters" but it went a bit wrong and it does not mean my letters or Patrick's letters :)
